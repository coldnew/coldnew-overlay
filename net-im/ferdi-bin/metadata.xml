  <longdescription>
    Ferdi is a messaging browser that allows you to combine your favorite messaging
    services into one application.
    
    It is based on Franz - a software already used by thousands of people - with the
    difference that Ferdi gives you many additional features and doesn't restrict its
    usage!
    
    Ferdi is compatible with your existing Franz account so you can continue right where
    you left off.
