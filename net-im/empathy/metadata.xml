  <longdescription>Empathy consists of a rich set of reusable instant messaging
  widgets, and a GNOME client using those widgets. It uses Telepathy and Nokia's
  Mission Control, and reuses Gossip's UI. The main goal is to permit desktop
  integration by providing libempathy and libempathy-gtk libraries.
  libempathy-gtk is a set of powerful widgets that can be embeded into any GNOME
  application. A client application is provided.</longdescription>
