Swarm is a software package for multi-agent simulation of complex systems, originally developed at the Santa Fe Institute. Swarm is intended to be a useful tool for researchers in the study of agent based models. Swarm software comprises a set of code libraries which enable simulations of agent based models to be written in the Objective-C or Java computer languages. These libraries will work on a very wide range of computer platforms. The basic architecture of Swarm is the simulation of collections of concurrently interacting agents: with this architecture, we can implement a large variety of agent based models.
