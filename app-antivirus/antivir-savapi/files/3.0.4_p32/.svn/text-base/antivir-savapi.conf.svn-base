# UseSavapiProxy [0|1] 
#
# The proxy feature in SAVAPI performs scans more efficiently
# by using and reusing a prepared pool of scanners.  While this
# pool increases throughput this feature requires the pool size
# to be wisely chosen -- too many scanners will put load on the
# machine without gaining more performance, too few scanners may
# have the SAVAPI using applications wait unnecessarily.
#
# Default: UseSavapiProxy 0

UseSavapiProxy 1

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# PoolScanners [integer]
#
# The number of prepared AntiVir scanners in the pool.
# See option "UseSavapiProxy".
#

# It's also used for other temporary files like lock files.
#
# NOTE:
#
# The scanner backend does not recognize the environment variable
# "TMPDIR".
#
# IMPORTANT:
#
# You should also change the option "TemporaryDir" in MailGate's
# configuration file (default /etc/avmailgate.conf) when changing the
# option "ScanTemp".
# You're then sure that both components use the same temporary
# directory.
