		This is a framework for RTL synthesis tools. It currently has extensive
		Verilog-2005 support and provides a basic set of synthesis algorithms
		for various application domains.
		Yosys can be adapted to perform any synthesis job by combining the
		existing passes (algorithms) using synthesis scripts and adding
		additional passes as needed by extending the yosys C++ code base.
		Yosys is free software licensed under the ISC license (a GPL compatible
		license that is similar in terms to the MIT license or the 2-clause BSD
		license).
